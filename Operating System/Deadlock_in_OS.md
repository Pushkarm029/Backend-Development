### What is Deadlock?
- Deadlock is a situation that occurs in OS when any process enters a waiting state because another waiting process is holding the demanded resource.
- Deadlock is a common problem in multi-processing where several processes share a specific type of mutually exclusive resource known as a soft lock or software.

### Example of Deadlock
- A real-world example would be traffic, which is going only in one direction.
- Here, a bridge is considered a resource.
- So, when Deadlock happens, it can be easily resolved if one car backs up (Preempt resources and rollback).
- Several cars may have to be backed up if a deadlock situation occurs.
So starvation is possible.
